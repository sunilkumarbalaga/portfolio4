Description
My portfolio project is about top 5 fastest bikes.

Review
In my portfolio site I use css,html and javascript languages.

Specs
At the end of the lesson, will have a portfolio page added to their website. The portfolio page will list all of the projects we'll complete in our studies, and help begin a decent resume of your coding skills! In this lesson, we also delve a bit deeper into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and hyperlinks.

Take Away
Building a web page from scratch Basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Basic web page navigation through hyperlinks, aka anchor tags Relative vs absolute file paths Using git and GitHub

Work Flow
We're going to continue building out your website by adding a portfolio page where you can show off your work. We'll also spruce up the site by further developing the design with CSS.

To complete the assignment, below you'll find numbered TODO lesson steps. While reading this lesson, whenever you come across a TODO step, you are expected to implement this step, which may require you to create a file, or insert some HTML, CSS or JavaScript in the appropriate place. Please follow the instructions closely. Sometimes, however, we may be showing you code examples to make a point, so you only need to add code if we're explicitly telling you to do a lesson step, so please be aware of the actual lesson steps.
